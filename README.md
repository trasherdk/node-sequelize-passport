# Node.js, Express.js, PUG, Sequelize.js and Passport.js Boilerplate

Boilerplate to get started with Node.js, Express, Sequelize and Passport.js.

User Registration and authentication example.

Usually all Node.js projects are associated with MongoDB for the model, I wanted a boilerplate which was associated with Sequelize.js ORM.

## Pre-requisites:
* Read up on Node.js and create some simple Express.js sites
* Understand how routes work and play around with it
* Read up on ORM and Sequelize [here](http://sequelizejs.com/articles/getting-started) first and then [here](http://sequelizejs.com/articles/express)
* Understand how Passport.js works [here](http://toon.io/understanding-passportjs-authentication-flow/)
* Also understand how `connect-flash` works [here](https://gist.github.com/tpblanke/11061808)

### Start building cool apps on top of this boilerplate

* Copy env-sample to .env and edit to match your database setup.
